MP_SYS library.
Created using mingw c++ compiler and Bloodshed (c) Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 IDE
(visit http://www.blodshed.net)
Note: compile as a library (use included dev-cpp project file)
then use for link with when linking MEOW server.
Compile without ZIP support - zip support is not included into  (this) 
MEOW project distribution.
Also note that this is NOT FULL version of the library. Some files
were striped out due to no use for the MEOW project. However it compiles 
successfully with Dev-C++ .
