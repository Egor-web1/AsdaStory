MEOW server executable.
Created using mingw c++ compiler and Bloodshed (c) Dev-C++ 4.9.9.2 IDE
(visit http://www.blodshed.net)
Note: should compile with typical Dev-C++ installation
(use included .dev project file)
The executable goes directly into bin\MEOW_SERVER folder of the 
MEOW project installation. 
(where also meow_indy.dll should already be placed)
The project was once started on Pascal (nice tools to quickly build
up from scratch). But then my friend Roan (the Rocket) told me to rewrite 
all in C++ for serious programmers to work more easily with the sources.
Thanks to my friend for this advice and for great help with C coding.
